# myProcessScheduler
This project is initially forked from CPUScheduler by Marvin available at https://github.com/marvinjason/CPUScheduler

There are many changes propsed into the original code. The current version at my repository makes you to select the scheduling algorithm to implement, make you able to select the required no. of processes to simulate and let you enter data about each process to simulate.

There is another option given for comparison of the scheduling algorithms where the program simulates on sample data and show you the difference between each scheduling algo by working on the sample data.

In order to run the program, please compile Main.java (javac Main.java) and run it (java Main).
